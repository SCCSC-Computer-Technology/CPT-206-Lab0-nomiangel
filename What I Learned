#What I learned about GitHub

....it's confusing. Im excited yet intimitaded about GitHub. Mostly because its something new and I still don't fully understand it. From what I can see, it's a great place to come and share projects with fellows. It's
a great way to recieve feedback from others and see their points of view directly. I like how it allows you cuztomize and how safe proof it is. As in, someone who sees some other way to write a code can very easily
just clone it without affecting the orginal. That's pretty cool. Im still pretty confused as to how it works. For example using pull requests. Dont quite understand that. ***nothing a little exploring won't help***
